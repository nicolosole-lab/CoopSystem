# Fresh Test Data for Service Logs

Here's what we need to do to create fresh test data that will show up in Service Logs:

1. **Current Issue**: Existing time logs are dated December 2025 (future) and the staff member you're viewing may not have any logs

2. **Solution**: Create new Excel data with:
   - Current dates (January 2025)
   - The specific staff member you're viewing  
   - New external identifiers to avoid duplicate detection

3. **Steps**:
   - Create a small Excel file with 10-20 rows of test data
   - Use current dates (January 1-15, 2025)
   - Include the staff member: "UNKNOWN STAFF" (ID: 7a763e96...)
   - Use unique external identifiers (like TEST001, TEST002, etc.)
   - Include different clients and service types

This will create fresh time logs that will appear in the Service Logs section and allow you to test:
- Service log display
- Time tracking
- Compensation calculations  
- Staff rates integration
- Client assignments
