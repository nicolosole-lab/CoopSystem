Prompt: Implement GDPR Compliance in the Cooperative Management System

Objective:
Update the Cooperative Management System to be fully compliant with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), ensuring personal data is safeguarded and user privacy is protected.

Key Implementation Requirements:

Data Collection & Minimization

Review all database models and forms to ensure only necessary personal data is collected.

Add explicit field-level documentation for why each data point is required.

User Consent Management

Implement a consent form during account creation with a clear, accessible Privacy Policy link.

Store timestamped consent records in the database.

User Rights Features

Add user dashboard options for:

Data access/export (download in CSV/JSON format).

Data rectification (edit profile details).

Data erasure (“Right to be forgotten”) with confirmation steps.

Restrict or revoke consent for certain data processing activities.

Data Security

Encrypt personal data at rest (database encryption) and in transit (HTTPS/TLS).

Apply Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to ensure only authorized staff can access sensitive data.

Audit Logging

Track all personal data access, edits, and deletions with user ID, timestamp, and action type.

Data Retention & Deletion

Implement automatic data retention policies to delete or anonymize data after the legally required period.

Third-Party Service Compliance

Verify all external integrations (e.g., Fatture in Cloud, Firebase, email providers) have GDPR-compliant DPAs in place.

Data Breach Response Plan

Implement automated alerts for unauthorized access attempts.

Add breach reporting functionality to notify admins and prepare a notification for affected users within 72 hours.

Deliverables:

Updated database schema with GDPR annotations.

New UI components for user data management and consent.

Backend API endpoints for data access, export, rectification, and deletion.

Security review report confirming encryption and RBAC implementation.
